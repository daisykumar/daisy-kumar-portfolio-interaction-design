    Aftenposten: Digital Prototyping and Concept Development
</h1>
<button onclick="topFunction()" id="myBtn" title="Go to top">Top</button>

<p class="middle-para">

Working with a project from Aftenposten news brand was fun. I was lucky to be a part of lovely fellow students.
</p>
<p class="middle-para">
OVERVIEW: 
</p>
<p class="middle-para">
Aftenposten’s goal is to reach out to young people between 18 to 25 years and how it can carve out ways to connect itself as a news brand among them.
</p>
<p class="middle-para">
    <b>THE GOAL</b>
</p>
<p class="middle-para">
<B>Design Challenge:</B> How can Aftenposten present news and relevant content to young people (18-25) to increase use and engagement among them?
</p>
<p class="middle-para">
<B>MY ROLE IN THE TEAM:</B>
</p>
<p class="middle-para">
Research and Concept development was the main. In the later improved version, I iterated the user-experience of the Design and visual interface.
</p>

<h2>Process:
</h2>
<p class="middle-para">
As I mentioned in the previous project, I always like to change the process according to the design problems, the business needs, time-frame, etc. So, this time, we as a team began with research to know the user-personas, stakeholder’s expectations, and the competitors of Aftenposten. Let’s walk through the process. 
</p>

<h2 style="color: #433de0">1. Research: 
</h2>
<p class="middle-para">
<b>DEFINE THE USER</b>
</p>
<p class="middle-para">
Understanding the market of the news media and its consumers was vital for us. 
Interviewed the Ex-editor-in-chief and CEO at Aftenposten. Our discussions centered around- Aftenposten’s competitors in the market, characteristics of young generation as target-audience, why Aftenposten wants to reach them, the target-audience's customer-journey, and a lot more.
</p>
<p class="middle-para">
We also referred to the <b>Reuters report ‘How Young People Consume News and the Implications for Mainstream Media’ </b>to study the patterns of the young generation of 18 to 25 years of age. 
</p>
<p class="middle-para">
During our workings we first sorted out this group of 18 to 25 years old as ‘Gen Z’. Studying their characteristics, behaviour, news consumption habits became spontaneous.  
</p>
<p class="middle-para">
<b>Gen Z analysis:</b>
</p>
<p class="middle-para">
Also known as ‘iGeneration’- count Greta Thunberg and Zendaya among others- are an entirely new cohort of consumers. 
</p>
<p class="middle-para">
<b>Who are they?</b> A generation born between 1996 to 2010. Young and vibrant. Most-ethnically diverse. Grew up with technology and social media. Embrace entrepreneurialism and are eco-conscious. The mainstream media feel the need to focus on their approach of reaching out to the Gen Zers.
</p>
<p class="middle-para">
    Our next step was to carry the interviews on user-personas, and other factors influencing them. 
</p>
<p class="middle-para">
<b>User-Persona Interviews Results:</b>

<p class="middle-para">
<b>Anecdote Research:
</b>
</p>
<p class="middle-para">
Attending IxDa events at Oslo and another one at Schibsted Media majorly shaped our concept and formulated our user-personas further in our exciting journey. 
</p>
<p class="middle-para">
<b>The Expert Says about Gen Z:</b>
</p>
<p class="middle-para">
I've always believed in expert's opinions or well-known research sources. Carrying an interview with the expert who deals with Gen Z in his daily life was a useful source to shape our concept further.

    <b>Competition Analysis Graph:
    </b>
</p>
<p class="middle-para">
    The competition analysis of Aftenposten with its competitors gave us a clear understanding of the situation of the market. It also gave us a glimpse of Aftenposten's <b>brand positioning</b> in the market.
</p>

<p class="middle-para">
<b>HERMAN- THE USER-PERSONA:</b> It was the time to shape up our user-personas. Herman, an avid social media consumer, snapchat fan, was one of them.

</p>
<p class="middle-para">

        <li>

<h2 style="color: #433de0">2. Concept Development: 
</h2>
<p class="middle-para">
The Gen Z of the revamped Aftenposten, we called it, <b>MODUS,</b> posts articles that he or she comes across through feature <b>utrop or citizen journalism</b>. In this feature, they're free to post the incidents or events that they think are worth bringing to notice. Engages with like-minded youth. Gets his or her voice heard and awarded. Aftenposten receives the news posted by Gen Z users and approves those that it thinks best matches the interest of Gen Zers.
</p>
<p class="middle-para">
The birth of citizen journalism is often attributed to South Korea where the first platform of amateur generated information, <b>OhMyNews, </b>was created. The principle was simple; anyone can take part in the process of creating information – as the notion of participatory journalism (another term for citizen journalism) implies.
</p>
<p class="middle-para">
    <b>MODUS</b> is inspired by this very citizen journalism.
</p>

    <b>FEATURES OF MODUS:</b>

<p class="middle-para">

We chose a young and vibrant purple color as our main color. Typography was a combination of Merriweather that gives a feel of news and at the same it is balanced with Poppins to resonate with the Gen Zers.

<h2 style="color: #433de0">4. Test and Iteration: 
</h2>
<p class="middle-para">
Here’s our User Feedback:
</p>
<p class="middle-para">
In low-fi prototyping, we found out that the design of our stories were too similar to Instagram Stories.
</p>
<p class="middle-para">
We also found out that having both hamburger menu at the top and a menu bar at the bottom was confusing for the users.
</p>
<p class="middle-para">
We corrected these findings in the mid-fidelity. Differentiated our stories from instagram by using squares instead of circles. We also reduced it to one menu bar.
</p>
<p class="middle-para">
In the next user-testing, the grid looked tidy and the users liked our stories. However, no one noticed the MODUS slider nor the menu bar at the bottom. 
</p>

    <p class="middle-para">
    We recieved the much-awaited message from <b>Espen Egil Hansen, Aftenposten, Ex-editor-in-chief and CEO</b>. He chose the design and concept of <b>utrop or citizen journalism </b> from the prototype. The overall design was well-recieved.
